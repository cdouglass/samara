# Samara

This is an interpreter for a small programming language based on the simply-typed lambda calculus with [type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_inference) and syntax loosely based on [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

## Examples

## The name

Botanically, a [samara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara_(fruit)) is a seed surrounded by a papery wing allowing it to be carried by the wind. Maple, ash, and in particular elm trees all produce these.
